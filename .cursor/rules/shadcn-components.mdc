# Shadcn Components Usage Guidelines

## Overview
This rule defines the guidelines for using shadcn components in the project. Shadcn components should be the preferred choice for UI elements when available.

## Rules

1. **Component Selection**
   - Always prefer shadcn components over custom components when available
   - Check the existing shadcn componentns before implementing custom components
   - Use the component documentation as the source of truth for implementation

2. **Component Installation**
   - DO NOT attempt to install shadcn components automatically
   - If a required shadcn component is not installed:
     1. Notify the user that the component needs to be installed
     2. Provide the exact CLI command for installation
     3. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
     4. Example installation command format: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`

3. **Component Usage**
   - Follow shadcn's recommended patterns and best practices
   - Use the component's TypeScript types and props as defined in the documentation
   - Maintain consistent styling by using the project's theme configuration

4. **Customization**
   - Customize shadcn components through the theme configuration when possible
   - Avoid direct style overrides unless absolutely necessary
   - Document any customizations made to the base components

## Examples

### Correct Usage
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function ButtonDemo() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>
}

```

### Component Installation Request
When a component is needed but not installed:
1. Inform the user: "The [component-name] component from shadcn is required but not installed."
2. Provide the installation command: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
3. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with implementation
